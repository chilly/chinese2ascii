Yes, this applet is inspired by Figlet fonts.  However it doesn't use any other fonts.  ASCII characters input here will simply be removed before conversion (only Unicode chinese will be converted).

Many thanks to the various authors of codeset such as EUC_TW, EUC_CN, GB2312-80, CNS, HZ, the makers of java encodings, and to Ngai Kim Hoong and Erik.

Convert your simplified chinese unicode text to 16x16 ascii pictures.

The back end is controlled by figlet fonts and unicode.
