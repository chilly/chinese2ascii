chinese2ascii

by Lukas Saul

Yes, this applet is inspired by Figlet fonts.  However it doesn't use any other fonts.  ASCII characters input here will simply be removed before conversion (only Unicode chinese will be converted).

Many thanks to the various authors of codeset such as EUC_TW, EUC_CN, GB2312-80, CNS, HZ, the makers of java encodings, and to Ngai Kim Hoong and Erik.

If you would like to see other encodings supported, or can tell me something about related figlets for chinese, please email: info@javaspider.com.
